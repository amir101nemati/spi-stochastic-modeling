# Standardized Precipitation Index Analysis Using Stochastic Modeling

This project analyzes precipitation data in Tehran (2009â€“2019) using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The SPI is computed monthly and yearly based on the methodology proposed by Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders. The analysis incorporates statistical modeling and probability distributions to understand rainfall anomalies and drought conditions.

## Key Features
- SPI calculation using gamma distribution fitting
- Time series processing of rainfall data
- Visualization of monthly and annual SPI values
- Application of stochastic methods to climatology

## Stochastic Modeling Components
### 1. Markov Chains
- Transition matrices were estimated to model the probability of switching between wet, normal, and dry months.
- States are defined based on SPI thresholds, forming a discrete Markov Chain.

### 2. Continuous-Time Markov Processes
- Rainfall states are also analyzed over continuous time intervals to assess the duration and transition intensity between conditions.
  
### 3. Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Hidden Markov Models are used to identify underlying weather regimes not directly observed from SPI values.
- The forward-backward algorithm and state decoding were applied for analysis.
